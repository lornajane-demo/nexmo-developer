  <h2 id="discontinued">Shared short codes for Alerts discontinued</h2>
<p>Our carrier partner (AT&T) has announced plans to discontinue it's shared short code service for Alerts. This is an industry wide announcement that means Nexmo will no longer be able to provide this service. The service will be decommissioned in early 2019 and we'll provide advance notice as soon as we have more information. Dedicated short codes are still available.
